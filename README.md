# Refined Trump Speech Markov Chain
 A Markov chain generator with variable lengths and checks for proper sentence and quote ending. Dataset is from Trump's 2016 campaign speeches, but can be easily swapped out for something else. Trump speeches are used just because I think its funny, I do not endorse that Donald Trump

 I intend to eventually move and incorporate this into a new project once it is finished, so the system is made to be able to handle data not included in the given dataset

Instructions
---
Upon starting the program, it will output some diagnostic info and a generated quote. Press enter to generate another, or type up to 3 consecutive words to get a list of potential words that could be generated after it. There will be duplicate words, which represents a higher likelyhood of that word being generated next.
