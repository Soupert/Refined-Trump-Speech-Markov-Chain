# Refined Trump Speech Markov Chain
 A Markov chain generator with variable lengths and checks for proper sentence and quote ending. Dataset is from Trump's 2016 campaign speeches, but can be easily swapped out for something else. Trump speeches are used just because I think its funny, I do not endorse that Donald Trump

 I intend to eventually move and incorporate this into a new project once it is finished, so the system is made to be able to handle data not included in the given dataset
