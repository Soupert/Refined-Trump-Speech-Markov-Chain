# Refined-Trump-Speech-Markov-Chain
 A Markov chain generator with variable lengths and checks for proper sentence and quote ending. Dataset is from Trump's 2016 campaign speeches, but can be easily swapped out for something else. Trump speeches are used just because I think its funny, I do not endorse that guy
